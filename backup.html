				<h1>Libraries Rebuild Lives and Communities</h1>
				<p>Rebuilding after the pandemic isn’t simply a matter of putting back what was once there. We’ve learned “what was there” wasn’t working for everybody. Libraries as centers of community and civic engagement will help all residents reach beyond systemic inequities and help breathe life back into shuttered communities.</p>

				<p>Massachusetts uses LSTA funding to provide libraries with direct grants to meet the needs of their communities. Over the past two years, $813,329 in direct grant funding went to ninety-seven different libraries.</p>
				<p>In addition to direct grants, LSTA funding is used for statewide services including the new eBook program LEA, online databases, and the Commonwealth Catalog. Below are details on how LSTA money has funded these programs over the past two years.</p>
				<p>$250,000 was spent on LEA, the new eBook platform through Overdrive that allows Massachusetts residents access to any eBook across the state. Before LEA, patrons were restricted to their own home network’s eBook collections. Now, eBooks are treated more like physical materials and can be shared across network lines. The program gives users access to over 350,000 eBooks and audiobooks.</p>
				<p>$1,563,968 was spent on the Statewide Databases. These include thousands of articles from newspapers, magazines, journals, encyclopedias, academic books, other reliable research and reference sources - and more. They are available to every Massachusetts resident free of charge.</p>
				<p>$362,731 was spent on the Commonwealth Catalog. This allows residents to broaden their library searches outside of their home networks. Residents can search through over50 million items available at participating public and academic libraries. Once a request is made, the item is shipped to the requester’s home library for pick up.</p>

		<h1>Seventh Congressional District</h1>
		<h2>Virtual Programming Grants</h2>
		<p>CARES Act funding was used to create grant opportunities for libraries in Massachusetts to increase virtual programming opportunities in their communities. Libraries applied for grants to purchase recording equipment including cameras, microphones, and editing software; materials to create crafting and science kits that residents could pick up curbside; and to hire professionals to host events that were available to all Massachusetts residents through the MBLC’s Virtual Events Calendar.</p>
		<p>In the Seventh Congressional District, libraries in Chelsea and Somerville received a combined total of $5,918 in these grants.</p>
		<h2>Summer Distance Learning Grants</h2>
		<p>Libraries needed to adopt quickly to continue providing summer services that are expected by communities in a safe and accessible manner. To assist them, we provided a total of $117,500 of CARES Act and LSTA funding to libraries that requested it to purchase summer reading tracking software Beanstack. This allowed summer reading to continue while children, teens, and adults were at home.</p>
		<p>In addition, LSTA funding was used to support expanding the concept of summer learning in libraries beyond reading. In the Seventh Congressional District, the Cambridge Public Library received a $3,245 Summer Learning grant.</p>

				<h4>Citizenship Corners and Expanded English Language Services - Somerville Public Library</h4>
				<p>Somerville has 11,103 foreign-born residents who are not US citizens and 9,395 households in which English is not spoken at home. As federal immigration policies evolve, more Somerville residents are seeking to become citizens. Many, however, have low English proficiency that disqualifies them from enrolling in citizenship classes they need to pass their interview. Local ESOL classes fill quickly and have long waiting lists, and none currently accelerates learning by combining ESOL with civics. Somerville Public Library (SPL)’s Pathways to Citizenship program will train 30 immigrants via a 28-hour combined ESOL/Civics Awareness class, offer four USCIS citizenship workshops to 130 patrons, develop Citizenship Corners in three libraries, provide all SPL staff with Cultural Humility Training, and create and test a Training-of-Trainers program to sustain the ESOL/Civics class with committed volunteer trainers.</p>

				<h4>Protecting Priority Collections - Massachusetts Eye and Ear – Howe Library, Boston</h4>
				<p>The Howe Library will improve preservation and access to the collections in the Abraham Pollen Archives by implementing the recommendations from a previous Preservation Needs Assessment. This will improve intellectual control and access to the recently rediscovered, internationally significant, and at-risk medical instrument collection. This project will help the Library provide a safer environment for the Archives and provide increased access to a truly unique special collection, supporting research and engagement from the entire Massachusetts Eye and Ear community, outside researchers, and the general public.</p>

				<h4>Serving Teens and Tweens - Canton Public Library</h4>
				<p>The Canton Public Library has identified a need for tweens and teens that can best be addressed by expanding its services, programming, and materials to focus on issues related to mind, body, and world wellness. Having surveyed young people that are current library users and those that are not, the Library is aware of their feelings of overwhelming stress and anxiety. As an already trusted institution, teens and tweens know the Library is here to help. This project will focus on providing opportunities to improve the health and happiness of young patrons, as well as encourage more meaningful engagement among the regular young adults the Library serves every day.</p>

				<h4>Mind in the Making - Kingston Public Library</h4>
				<p>The Kingston Public Library will create a larger Play Space for children ages birth through 6 years. The new Mind in the Making Play Space will provide its youngest patrons and their caregivers opportunities to develop social-emotional life skills. Giving children a safe Play Space in Kingston’s community is essential. A committed space that can replicate the playtime children experience during and after story time will make the Library more inclusive. A dedicated Play Space will add more opportunities for personal growth.</p>

				<h4>Health and Wellness - New Bedford Free Public Library</h4>
				<p>The City of New Bedford, recently designated an AARP Age-Friendly Community, is committed to providing assistance and resources to its aging population. According to the 2010 Census, New Bedford had 18,765 residents over the age of 60, representing almost 20% of the population, and this number is expected to increase in the 2020 Census. Through multiple surveys and needs assessments, the City learned that its seniors are most concerned with nutrition, managing chronic health conditions, and coping with cognitive decline. With this project, the Library will address some of these concerns with books and resources, hands-on programs promoting a healthy lifestyle via fitness and nutrition, and by bringing in experts to educate and inform on topics related to senior health and wellness issues.</p>
